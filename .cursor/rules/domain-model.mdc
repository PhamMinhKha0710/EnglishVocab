## Implementation Details

All domain entities inherit from [BaseEntity.cs](mdc:src/Backend/EnglishVocab.Domain/Common/BaseEntity.cs) which provides:
- ID (long type for better performance)
- CreatedBy (string)
- ModifiedBy (string)
- DateCreated (DateTime)
- DateModified (DateTime?)

Identity models are separate from domain entities and are used for authentication and authorization.

Changes tracking is handled by the Infrastructure layer via UserAction entities and overridden SaveChangesAsync method.
